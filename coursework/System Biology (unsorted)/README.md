  - Dynamics of network motifs

2. Cell signaling network
  - Simulation tools, Bifurcation theory
  - Multisite phosphorylation, stoichiometric inhibitors, and positive feedback
  - Cascades, bistable switches, and oscillators
    
3. Dynamic modes in cell signaling
  - Negative feedback and oscillations
  - Perfect adaptation
    
4. Noise in Biological network
  - Simulations methods of stochastic systems (Gillespie & Tau-leap)
  - Effects of noise on the dynamics of biological networks
