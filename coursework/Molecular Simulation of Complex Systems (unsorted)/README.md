These are the coursework assignments for **Molecular Simulation of Complex System**, which covers four main topics:

1. Monte Carlo simulation
- Importance sampling Monte Carlo 
- Case study: 3D Lennard-Jones fluid

2. Molecular simulation
- MD simulations of Lennard-Jones fluid
- Calculation of dynamic properties

3. Dissipative particle dynamics

4. Lipids system



**Declaration**:

The C++ scripts in this directory are all provided by [Prof. Hu Jinglei](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/af/be/c8328a176062/page.htm) in class.

In the completion of exercises, writing shell scripts to process data and drawings, and modifying some parameters in C++ code are requested, which were completed by me independently.
